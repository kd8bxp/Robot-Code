## Robot Code

This repository is an archive of various robot code for robot that either I own
or have owned in the past, it's an attempt to preserve the code, while freeing up some space on my system.

Feel free to use any of this, or none of this - As with most things the IDE has changed and been updated.
Most of this code is old, so there is no promises made that any of it will still work.
(It all worked at one time thou)

some of this code is my own, some of it is not - and maybe under a different license.
